Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''of course what do i know im only lvl 54''
Julz: worldsays, ''he wouldnt want to try his luck and get pwned again''
MrbigStuff: worldsays, ''how do u kill them''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''well if u can survive a round of them beating you up just have ur summon attack them... there hp sucks usually one hit can do the trick''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''only bad thing... you cant heal against them''
MrbigStuff: worldsays, ''ok im on my way ''
MrbigStuff: worldsays, ''what!!!!''
MrbigStuff: worldsays, ''why''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''no magic can be used against them''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''or be used at all''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''usually overly sized cooked meat does the trick but no houses''
MrbigStuff: worldsays, ''rats''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''oh yeah they do bout 150k dmg a hit so be carefull''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''they only got like 100k hp though''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''and the main reason i hate them is they no beat''
SL-Xendor: worldsays, ''but dont worry they can make u this quickly''
MrbigStuff: worldsays, ''i try anyway the only i will lose is money''
SL-Xendor: worldsays, ''yeah i went broke against them i forgot to put my money up and they only give 1k gold a kill''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''oh yeha my king slime on that guy is lvl 66 i think''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''so ull lvl quickly against them so trust me its worthless''
Julz: worldsays, ''66? holey shit''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''wait worth it''

Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''just tryen to help''
MrbigStuff: worldsays, ''i will give it a shot''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''it may be harder now''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''when i did it, it was when you always attack first''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''but of course then again summon couldnt attack until after they did so i guess its possible''
MrbigStuff: worldsays, ''straight attack no magic right''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''yeah''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''but ur summon can prolly 1 hit it if i remember correctly''
MrbigStuff: worldsays, ''more hammerheads''

Emtee: worldsays, ''it was easier to train my my summon with a mage since i could use lower spells''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''priest is the ultimate summon user''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''because it gots the ability heal''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''it can heal every turn and let the summon do all the work...''
Emtee: worldsays, ''my monster can heal too''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''but blue slimes heal at random... heal is only good for king slimes... u get healers at to high a lvl for them to be worth anything''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''but if u heal with ur priest... u could use ur summon to do all the major dmg''
Emtee: worldsays, ''there is no way it will be stronger than me''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''expecially since weaknesses loses there point for awhile after u get past evil humans on dungeon 3''
Emtee: worldsays, ''what weakness?''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''u know if there weak to the element they do 250% dmg''
Emtee: worldsays, ''i dont have element''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''yeah but u dont got heal like priests''

Emtee: worldsays, ''well the way we play we dont need heal''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''i should be priest... but im not =O''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''lol yeah all u gotta do is that move that does 1/3 of there hp on bosses... and u can cut through there hp in no time''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''assassins r the ultimate boss destroyer''
Emtee: worldsays, ''which one is it we dont have skills description anymore''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''masterfull death or somethen''
Emtee: worldsays, ''the only skills i use now is mp drain and speed attack''

Emtee: worldsays, ''well its my only skills that do damage''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''yeah ur gonna get it tough as u move up''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''assassins take time to lvl... but mets prolly gonna make that pay off later in game''
Xendor V.2: worldsays, ''my summons only lvl 43 and it needs the exp for bout lvl 10 KS''
Emtee: worldsays, ''did he change the level requirement because last time i could level easly with summons''

Lilithia: worldsays, ''when did i agree with what?''
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''saying that &#34;People&#34; are annoyed when you are the only one, is stupid''
Tib-Mijou: worldsays, ''that isnt agreeing''

Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''thank you, i will''
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''first of all, i think slimes are retarded looking now''
Lilithia takes out the popcorn
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''this game is Dragon Warrior based, and was built arround the concept and graphings of Dragon Warrior''
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''the images for most monsters in this game were taken from Dragon Warrior, as were the names''
Tib-Mijou: worldsays, ''and they were updated to a better look''
Tib-Mijou: worldsays, ''okay  thats all folks''
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''for metroid to change the most consistant monsters used in the Dragon Warrior series of games was a mistake''
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''that isnt all''
Lilithia finds out he ate all his popcorn in the kidsize cup and buy a extremely large bag and begins to eat some more popcorn
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''you cant stop me during a speach and say &#34;Thats All&#34;''
Tib-Mijou: worldsays, ''1.I made them, and made many new colors. and it doesnt matter if its changed, if things in life didnt change then life would suck''
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''and the truth comes out''
Tib-Mijou: worldsays, ''??''
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''the person who thinks DW is outdated was the one that changed the images''
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''if i made these images, i gauruntee met wouldnt have used them''
Tib-Mijou: worldsays, ''u just refuse to adjust -.-''
Crazy Carl: worldsays, ''because i have to tell you, they suck''

She says, &#39;&#39;Sit down Leroy. All the children rush to find seats.  &#39;&#39;Well,&#39;&#39; says the social worker, then you must be here to sign up. I&#39;ll need all your children&#39;s names.&#39;&#39;  &#39;&#39;This one&#39;s my oldest - he is Leroy.&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;OK, and who&#39;s this one?&#39;&#39; Well, this one he is Leroy, also.&#39;&#39; The social worker raises an eyebrow but continues. One by one, through the oldest four, all boys, all named Leroy. Then she is introduced to the eldest girl, named Leighroy!  &#39;&#39;All right...&#39;&#39; says the caseworker, &#39;&#39;I&#39;m seeing a pattern here. Are they ALL named Leroy?&#39;&#39; Their Momma replied, &#39;&#39;Well, yes - it makes it easier. When it is time to get them out of bed and ready for school, I just yell &#39;Leroy!&#39; An&#39; when it&#39;s time for dinner, I just yell &#39;Leroy!&#39; an&#39; they all come a runnin.&#39; An &#39;if I need to stop the kid who&#39;s running into the street, I just yell &#39;Leroy&#39; and all of them stop. It&#39;s the smartest idea I ever had, namin&#39; them all Leroy.&#39;&#39;  The social worker thinks this over for a bit, then wrinkles her forehead and says tentatively, &#39;&#39;But what if you just want ONE kid to come, and not the whole bunch?&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;Ah, that&#39;s so easy,&#39;&#39; said the momma. &#39;&#39;Then I calls them by their last names.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;''

Zax: worldsays, ''Oh, hey, where you playing that Mafia game yesterday?''
West: worldsays, ''Yes, I was.''
Zax: worldsays, ''I remember you''
West: worldsays, ''This isn&#39;t my login name, and it&#39;s rather common among my team''
Zax: worldsays, ''What&#39;s a Bronze Monster Medal for?''

West: worldsays, ''195 Bronze Medals''
Zax: worldsays, ''Ah, I see, I just got two''
Zax: worldsays, ''I wish that Mafia game was running, I got addicted to it''
West: worldsays, ''It&#39;s a good game, but not many people run good Mafia games anymore.''
Zax: worldsays, ''It&#39;s addictive''
West: worldsays, ''Back in the day, my team and I would alternate running our Prime server for days.''
Zax: worldsays, ''Then run one later''
West: worldsays, ''But we actually had a game that consistantly held more than 10 people for 2 straight days.''
Zax: worldsays, ''Awesome''
West: worldsays, ''I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll have the time or the resources to bring that many people on-line to play anymore. Some of my core members have gone to other things.''

West: worldsays, ''Your color denotes you basic level''

West: worldsays, ''I&#39;m purple, chief''
Zax: worldsays, ''I know''
West: worldsays, ''I&#39;d telll you what level makes you purple, but it&#39;s a bannable offense.''
Zax: worldsays, ''I don&#39;t care what level makes what color really, as long as my slime doesn&#39;t look like a woman''
West: worldsays, ''Color only means power, bud.''
Zax: worldsays, ''I know, but I like certain colors more than others''
West: worldsays, ''4700 HP, 6900 MP, 2000 Attack and 2700 Agility...''
Zax: worldsays, ''Well I&#39;m sexier''
West: worldsays, ''It&#39;s a proven fact that the color purple is actually more attactive to the opposite sex than a royal blue color.''
Zax: worldsays, ''I just like the color blue''
Zax: worldsays, ''Where in the world am I?''

Pudin360: worldsays, ''i know of a moment in Tales of Symphonia thats nearly impossible''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''I think.''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''how tough are the metal slimes?''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''in DW3, you could only do 1 damage to em at a time, but they only had 4 hp''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''You could use BeDragon to do more damage''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''yea, i know''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''and the poisen needle can still 1-hit them''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''and the 1 armor still does damage/2 to them when they hit you with a physical attack''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''I wonder if they&#39;re King Metals in there..''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''In that secret cave you wish for.''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''i dont think so''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''my summon is gotta have to get tons of levels so i dont lose any mp when we merge''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''It just adds all of it&#39;s stats to yours.''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''really? i was told that it averages them together''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''Yay, I can train on Ice Babbles.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''=o''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''Hey Lue.''
Lue: worldsays, ''Hey''
Lue: worldsays, ''woah that came out like 4 seconds after i typed it''
Lue: worldsays, ''hahah i can turn off npc say''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''im crazy! i set my max encounter thing to 10!''
Lue: worldsays, ''you can adjusty that?''
Lue: worldsays, ''*adjust''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''its a 1 time thing''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''you can change it once, but cant change it again''
Lue: worldsays, ''i made it 0''
Lue: worldsays, ''i think i am going to hate my self''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''if its below 4 when you set it, it cancels''
Lue: worldsays, ''well it won&#39;t let me try to do it again''
Lue: worldsays, ''i don&#39;t like these new stat pannels &gt;.&lt;''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''then its probobly stuck on 4''
Lue: worldsays, ''have any of you guys seen ball?''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''maybe i should rename my summon once i can merge with it''
Lue: worldsays, ''have you ever played any of the more recent pokemon games?''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''yes, illegally of course''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''i like the old ones better tho''
Lue: worldsays, ''you ever play emerald?''
Lue: worldsays, ''i wanna know if it has all the pokemon in ruby and sapphire''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''*checks ROM&#39;s name* yes, i played it, but not the other new ones''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''Emerald has some Kanto and Johto Pokemon''
Lue: worldsays, ''so is it posible to get all 283 without training?''
Lue: worldsays, ''*trading''
Lue: worldsays, ''in emerald''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''you have to trade to get the trade-evolution only ones''
Lue: worldsays, ''but otherwise''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''im kinda sure, but not totally''

Pudin360: worldsays, ''so, who wants to tell my what my character should do for a battle?''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''well, ur a mage in the early 300s''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''so i would probably go around the Curers''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''Maybe the Hammer Lords''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''i could go against the super warriors until they got the ability to attack before me''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''lol''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''Healers can pwn me...Golems can sometimes pwn me........I shouldnt have tried the Golem boss and now I&#39;m stuck on golems to train on with out getting pwnt much &gt;_&lt;''
Michael: worldsays, ''i could own them... &gt;.''
Michael: worldsays, ''holy cross...''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''you shouldnt face a monster until you can 1-hit kill them''
Michael: worldsays, ''thats what i&#39;ve been doing..''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''i can 1-hit kill almost any non-boss monster''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''mathematically it makes sense''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''with beat''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''dude its reeal hard to do 1 hit on bosses its almost impossible it took more then 100 hits on 2 of those bosses''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''mages pawn all with beat''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''if only this game had the spell defeat''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''omg, someone OTHER than me is playing this because they like Dw!??!!''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''yep''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''woot''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''Pudin, will you plz help me get enough gold for enough tokens for a Babble?''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''the true thing that can pwn all is the poisen needle''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''anyway, bosses would be easier to kill if you didn&#39;y face them when you were lvl 20''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''im the same level as you, and i&#39;m facing Hammer Men''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''you are stuck on golems''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''more specifically, a thief with poisen needle that also has the accessory that adds 100 agility''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''dude I could kill a Warrior Slime or what ever they were and not get hurt and the next enemy and the next enemy but I got hurt some''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''haha''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''i never get hurt''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''im preparing my blue slime to merge''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''thats gonna pawn''
Mr.Slimey would get pwnt if he didnt have his Summon that takes most of the strong hits and gets killed
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''exactly''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''why dont you have a can...of poison? (that was to the 3 golems that I&#39;m fighting)''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''the town thats name depends on the name of the dealer you send to build it is hilarious if your dealer has a wierd name (DW3 talk &lt;---)''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''yup''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''i love DW3''
Michael: worldsays, ''My hammers do like... 10k of damage''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''2nd fav of mine''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''DWM is the bomb tho''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''DWM was actually the first Game Boy Color game''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''Pudin, will you plz help me get enough gold for enough tokens for a babble?''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''it was released a few days before the console itself''
Michael: worldsays, ''I loved dwm, it was basically all i played on gbc...''

HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''speed the game up by 10x the speed''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''do you mean Read Only Memory by rom?''
Michael: worldsays, ''I didnt know about roms at the time... -.-''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''i forget what it stands for''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''im almost broke, i was generous earlier and gave 2 million gold and a KS crystal to Michael''

Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''can you help me when you are rich again?''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''yea''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''i once did get all 215 monsters''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''k thx''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''a babble only costs 15000''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''you get more than that it one battle''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''liah''
Michael hugs the KS crystal
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''i used to be a higher level than that as a mage''
Michael hugs his KS crystal
Pudin360: worldsays, ''the most i can get from 1 battle right now is.... 125000''
HelterSkelter: worldsays, ''the LOWEST monster in that world gives 3000 gold for a kill''

Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''of course Hyper, you cant normally get them until ur like...stronger than it''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''at first, at least =X''

Hyper: worldsays, ''I love assassin speed ^^''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''There are 3 portals there as well.  Each one makes a different location in which you are transported to.  They all in the end lead to the same place,''

Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''haha''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''that one is nice''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''i dont think u can cast it yet tho''
Hyper: worldsays, ''Oh yeah. I can merge my monsters? And no way can I cast it yet. It costs 500 mana.''
Hyper: says, ''You see no one &gt;&gt;''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''i forget what level the mergining is''
Hyper: worldsays, ''Mergining?''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''u can merge with ur pet''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''so that ur ultra strong''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''because heres a gist on the pet system''
Hyper: worldsays, ''Wow. I think I&#39;ll wait till he gets stronger though.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''every level they get, gets added on''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''for example''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''if at level up, he gets +5 to HP''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''and next level he gets +12''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''thats because, 7 was added to the original 5''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''it stacks''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''so sooner or later''
Hyper: worldsays, ''Ah''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''hes getting like 99999999999999999999999999999999999999999 a level''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''well, thats an exaderation''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''anyway, not only do his gains stack, so does his exp needed''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''first level, lets say its +10''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''next it can be +15, then +24, +50 etc''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''it stacks as well, making it alot harder''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''thats so that I didnt have to make req levels''
Hyper: worldsays, ''Meaning merging early on is bad.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''u cant merge early on''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''theres a level limiit''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''i think its 250''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''or 500''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''plus ur pet needs max loyalty, which is 250''
Hyper: worldsays, ''Revert monster?''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''turns it back into the crystal''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''it goes back to level 1''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''if you want to save ur pet''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''use the monster saver''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''in about the middle of town''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''has a flamish color''
Hyper: worldsays, ''I&#39;ve talked to him.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''yeah, thats for saving monsters''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''if ur giving ur pet to another person, u have to revert it''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''to prevent newbs from getting ultra strong or something because their friend gave them a level 1000000000000000000 king slime''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''also prevents newbs from using pets that they cant use''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''more powerful pets cannot be turned into pets from crystals unless they are the correct retreiver level''
Hyper: worldsays, ''Oh.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''RL goes up by completeing retriever missions''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''in the second town, which u cannot go to yet, there are Sub quests as well as Retriever missions''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''to advance in the game, you need to do RM''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''RMs*''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''but doing sub quests could get u some nice stuff''
Hyper: worldsays, ''I still ned to train on normal slimes even thouhg I do over 30 damage to them per turn.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''you cant even leave town until you pass the 3rd dungeon''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''which no one has done, because they are too lazy''
Hyper: worldsays, ''I can do it o.o''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''u need like level 500 or 600 if i remember correctly''
Hyper: worldsays, ''o.o;''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''fortunatly, its not very hard to level''
Hyper: worldsays, ''I can still do it.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''of course u can''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''u just gotta be not lazy''
Hyper: worldsays, ''When bluu kills it says 2x exp. Does that mean for both of us?''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''no, for him''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''he actually gets 3x exp, if i remember correctly''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''its been a while since ive worked on this game&#39;s code''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''since no one has really done anything for a while''
Hyper: worldsays, ''Oh well it says 2x''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''i feel there is no reason to''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''well yeah, 2x + the normal''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''i think thats what i did, lemme check''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''oh and got my numbers mixed up''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''its level 125 and 250 loyalty to merge''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''that level being the PET&#39;s level''
Hyper: worldsays, ''I think I&#39;ll wait to merge even after that.''
Hyper: worldsays, ''I think I have enough bronze slime medals.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''ahhhh nevermind''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''its 2x exp''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''i musta fixed it''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''i know at one point it was 3x''
Hyper: worldsays, ''Oh all right.''
Hyper: worldsays, ''What does revert monster do? Oh right.''
Hyper: worldsays, ''I&#39;d best not click it.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''if u do''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''theres a warning first''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''id get more complaints than hell can make if i didnt''
Hyper: worldsays, ''Heh heh. Yep''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''&#34;I WAS JUST SEEING WHAT IT DID AND I LOST MY PET&#34;''

Exgear1: worldsays, ''ohhh''
Exgear1: worldsays, ''but does it do good damage if it fails''
Pudin360: worldsays, ''it does nothing at all if it fails other than eat up the mp you used to cast it''

Wvoulfe: worldsays, ''brb''
Xion: worldsays, ''I saw that The King Metal Slime gives like 32k exp... thats probably the best thing to level up on at the end of the game.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''Or maybe it&#39;s designed so you choose one specific weapon to put points in?''
Xion: worldsays, ''Nah, I think you at least get 2-3 skills to have mastered.''
Xion: worldsays, ''Why else would Hero have to master 2 skills to get his ultamite move.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''What, BigBang?''

Ryden: worldsays, ''The boss in every dungeon is usually the weakest monster in the next are you go too.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''Yep.''
Knlbr: worldsays, ''I see''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''O_O''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''That means...King Slimes are the weakest monster in the next dungeon? =O!''

Ryden: worldsays, ''laugh* How I got last, I will never know.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''Heh.''
Ryden: says, ''''
Knlbr: worldsays, ''its a misspell of the century, omg!''
Ryden: worldsays, ''I had a brain fart.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''King Slimes are the weakest enemy outside of town.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''It really smells, too.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''You have a character that&#39;s beaten Dungeon 3?''
Ryden: worldsays, ''I believe King Red Slimes are the weakest in dungeon 4, and they do like 2 mil damage.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Yeah, I do.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''=O''
Ryden: worldsays, ''He sucks though.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Cause I rushed. =O''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''Did you fuse with a pet yet?''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Nope...''
Ryden: worldsays, ''I did it when fusion wasn&#39;t added.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''Ah.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''My priest has fused twice though.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Stronger then my warrior, but its hp sucks so bad, a KS could kill him with one nuke.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''I&#39;m gonna give the Metal Slimes a shot.''
Knlbr: worldsays, ''time to stock up tokens and buy a better summon :D''
Ryden: worldsays, ''How much HP you got?''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Aura.''
Knlbr: worldsays, ''10 tokens for a babble, 1,5k''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''About 206k.''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''306k*''
Knlbr: worldsays, ''each, 15k''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Metal slimes always take 3 or more hits to kill.''
Knlbr: worldsays, ''to buy all of it''
Aura-Djoni: worldsays, ''And how hard do they hit you?''
Ryden: worldsays, ''And if they use beat your doomed.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''I believe 150k a hit.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''With spells anywyas.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''anyways*''
Ryden: worldsays, ''And KS can&#39;t heal you against them.''
Knlbr: worldsays, ''hmmm, can I exchange my summons back for more tokens?''
Ryden: worldsays, ''If you go against one you might be able to win, and get the 100k exp though.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Heres a hint, fight evil humans until theres one left, then run away, and go to the metal slimes, and see if you can kill one alone.''
Knlbr: worldsays, ''Knlbr fell on Knlbr&#39;s head from the fall, but for some reason, Knlbr doesn&#39;t feel a thing!''
Knlbr: worldsays, ''is it possible to fall on my own head''

Chobin: worldsays, ''''
Youkai-Inuyasha: worldsays, ''monsters yeah, but not beasts''

Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''Well my net name is just 2 words put in japanese.''
DarckSol: says, ''Hi.''
Chobin: says, ''hello''
Chobin: worldsays, ''what purpose do the monster medals serve besides being there''
Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''As of now, none.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Well, if you use them correctly you could score yourself some slime action.''
Chobin: worldsays, ''O-o''
Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''lol''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Slime action is basically you turning into an orange slime.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Then all your stats boost by 50,000,000,000 as you can use a super ultra slime buster attack.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Sadly it only lasts for .0000000000000001 second so its like it was never there to begin with.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Does that explain everything for you?''
Chobin: worldsays, ''nope''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Ah, well your young, you will understand when your 84 like I am.''
Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''No slime action is when a boy slime and a girl slime get together and get it on. The medals contribute to this as being bling and acttacting the ladies.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Nope, sorry... slimes produce asexually, sex for them is just bouncing up and down.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''And they do that all the time. (Notice there icon).''
Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''lol''
Chobin: says, ''uh hmm..''
DarckSol: says, ''Erm...''
Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''Thats Slime Sex not Slime action.''
Chobin: says, ''er...''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Slime action is what I explained earlier... when you turn orange.''
Chobin: worldsays, ''im stuck''
Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''Ok its when you turn orange.''
DarckSol: worldsays, ''I think this hallway should have been wider...slightly.''
Chobin: worldsays, ''perhaps...''
Ryden: worldsays, ''To bad it only lasts .0000000000000001 seconds.''
Chobin: worldsays, ''witch means it doesnt work at all''
Ryden: worldsays, ''You just haven&#39;t gotten 10000000000 gold medals yet, it works.''
Chobin: worldsays, ''why would someone do that''
DarckSol: worldsays, ''''
Ryden: worldsays, ''When you get to level 921 you get the ability to change every 10 bronze medals to a silver medal and 10 silver to a gold.''
Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''Because they lack any social or sex life.''
Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''Or what Ryden said''
Chobin: worldsays, ''you&#39;re a crazy person ryden''
Ryden: worldsays, ''No I&#39;m not into beastiality porn!''
Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''Sorry to say chobin but hes one of the most normal of the ppl that play this game.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Wait... nobody asked that... uhh... &gt;.&gt;''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Don&#39;t do drugs...''
Kagirinai Kenkaku: worldsays, ''They make you feel as though you are fighting against Ninja Penguins with your amory of demonic kittens.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Otherwise you will accidently make Slime Journey 3, the attack of the rainbow slime.''

Ryden: worldsays, ''My priest is around level 360, and it beats my level 450 warrior in every stat but hp.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''When you fuse with your summon it fuses your two stats together.''
Shadow: worldsays, ''then how did your hp go down or did it?''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Summons usually end up with lower hp then you, but higher stats then you.''

Pyramid106: worldsays, ''and they take forever to level up''
Ryden: worldsays, ''I got 339k hp, it would so kill that stat if I merged.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''On the other hand my mp will double.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''But who needs high mp when you got overly sized noodles at your disposal?''
Pyramid106: worldsays, ''i know''
Pyramid106: worldsays, ''and they say mergeing is needed to beat the game''
Ryden: worldsays, ''It is.''
Pyramid106: worldsays, ''???''
Ryden: worldsays, ''It boosts your stats up a lot.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''More then you can imagine.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''You just need to know when to merge with them.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''And what to merge with.''
Ryden: worldsays, ''Except KS&#39;s you can merge with them once there 125, and your stats would still go up a shiz load.''

Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''i posted a new screenshot''

Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''he can get up to a Babble''
Sarg: worldsays, ''he wants to know if he cant get back on if you can give him 2750 tokens. cause it took me a long time to save that up for him''
Sarg: worldsays, ''i gave it to his assassin but then he decides he wants to start a warrior''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''AH''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''?''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''What?''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''Ask him if right after he bought those tokens if the game crashed.''

Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''FINALLY''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''I found the bug at last!''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''BRb''
Sarg: worldsays, ''he took a step down the it crashed''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''He bought too many''
Sarg: worldsays, ''you cant buy 2750 tokens at one time?''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''If u buy too many, the server has to delay to make all of them, then the server crashes''
Sarg: worldsays, ''he bought the crystal ''
Sarg: worldsays, ''he had the tokens''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''It probably made them then crashed''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''At the same time''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''Either way, I know that the game keeps crashing after people buy too many''
Sarg: worldsays, ''so is his char screwed?''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''it shouldnt be if he got back on''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''gotta reboot the server''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''Wait''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''I&#39;m leveling.''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''Eek that was close.''

Sarg: worldsays, ''for real''
Mr.Dimey: says, ''Ehh, wrong char.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''you didnt create a new char did u?''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''wooh that was close''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''What was?''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''I ran the world too fast and it didnt load the save files correctly''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''I thought people were going to make new chars and fuck themselves over''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''I thought &#39;WTF!!!!&#39; when I saw chars missing and just sat there staring.''
Sarg: worldsays, ''lol''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''lol''
Sarg: worldsays, ''mine was there''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''Yeah I loaded the world too fast.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''Mine wasnt there either''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''X_X''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''When Sarg?  Right after the reboot or just 2 seconds ago?''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''Oh, and Polantaris, the K.S.s are easy, now I&#39;m doing brown trunk, gray top.''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''It might be because I weakended them?''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''I didnt think i weakened them that much''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''Ohh''
Sarg: worldsays, ''2 seonds ago''
Sarg: worldsays, ''seconds*''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''thats why Sarg''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''I reloaded the world twice''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''the first time i screwed up and made all the chars disspaear''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''Slimey I didnt weaken anything else''
Mr.Slimey: worldsays, ''Ahh''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''Interesting''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''maybe Xen is just a pussy''

Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''i dunno, o well''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''who else?''
Sarg: worldsays, ''me''

Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''so basically''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''it never asks who to cast it on, because it ends that''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''when that ends, the spell selection one ends, which ends the main battle phase, which then goes back to the main battle all together which has the opponent go''
Blu-Test-Polantaris: worldsays, ''did u get to select &#34;Beat&#34;?''
Sarg: worldsays, ''i selected it but it just went on the Flame Slime&#39;s turn''
